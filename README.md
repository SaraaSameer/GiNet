# GiNet: Integrating Sequential and Context-Aware Learning for Battery Capacity Prediction

## Introduction
This is the official implementation of the following paper: [GINET: Integrating Sequential and Context-Aware
Learning for Battery Capacity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04997). We propose GINET, a gated recurrent units enhanced Informer network, for predicting
battery’s capacity. The novelty and competitiveness of GINET
lies in its capability of capturing sequential and contextual
information from raw battery data and reflecting the battery’s
complex behaviors with both temporal dynamics and long-term
dependencies. We conducted an experimental study based on
a publicly available dataset to showcase GINET’s strength of
gaining a holistic understanding of battery behavior and pre-
dicting battery capacity accurately. GINET achieves 0.11 mean
absolute error for predicting the battery capacity in a sequence of
future time slots without knowing the historical battery capacity.
It also outperforms the latest algorithms significantly with 27%
error reduction on average compared to Informer. The promising
results highlight the importance of customized and optimized
integration of algorithm and battery knowledge and shed light
on other industry applications as well
