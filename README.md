# GiNet: Integrating Sequential and Context-Aware Learning for Battery Capacity Prediction

## Introduction
This is the official implementation of the following paper: [GINET: Integrating Sequential and Context-Aware Learning for Battery Capacity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04997). We propose GINET, a gated recurrent units enhanced Informer network, for predicting battery’s capacity. The novelty and competitiveness of GINET lies in its capability of capturing sequential and contextual information from raw battery data and reflecting the battery’s complex behaviors with both temporal dynamics and long-term dependencies.

## Dataset
The data utilized in this project comes from the following source and is publicly available: 
[Panasonic 18650PF Li-ion Battery Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wykht8y7tg/1)
